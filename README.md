🌐 What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language that forms the skeleton of every webpage. It tells the browser what to show and how the structure of the page looks.

🧱 Structure of a Basic HTML Document
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>

🎨 Adding Style

HTML is best friends with CSS. CSS handles colors, fonts, layouts, and all things stylish.

<p style="color: blue;">I am blue text!</p>

🧪 Adding Functionality

For smart behavior (like clicks and animations), HTML invites JavaScript to the party.

<script>
  alert("Hello Web!");
</script>

✅ Why Learn HTML?

Because every website from the tiniest blog to the biggest tech titan’s homepage uses it. It’s the gateway to web development.
